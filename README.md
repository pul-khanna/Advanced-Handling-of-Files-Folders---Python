<h1> Advanced Handling of Files and Folders Using Python </h1>

This was a demo project for a Solar Tech company where our raw data is a stream of data which gets recorded by the sensors on the field and is sent over the cloud.
The raw data has to transformed/cleansed into a desired format and then saved in a specific folder structure as described in our 'description.md' file.

This task focuses on handling of folders, their sub-directories and the files within by accessing and modifying raw data to create new files within a new specific folder structure using python. Here we will be making use of 'os' and 'pathlib' modules for handling of folders. Additionally, we will make use of 'pandas', 'numpy' and 'datetime' libraries to perform other tasks in an efficient way.

Look at the 'description.md' file to get detaile descriotion of the task.
